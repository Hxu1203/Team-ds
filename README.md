 Project Task #4: Every member in the team should now be invited to the group project repo as a collaborator.  Go ahead to clone the repo to a local machine then complete the following tasks,
1. Create a new branch call it something like norman-init or norman-collab (dont use my name please)
2. Add a folder to the main directory and name it something like norman-folder or norman-work (dont use my name please)
3. Add a readme txt file to the personal folder created in step 2 and write a short message to describe your work in this folder
4. Add, commit, and push --set-upstream origin <branch name> to the remote
5. After the push, make sure DO NOT submit a PULL REQUEST on GitHub
Try to get it done by 10/9/2022, Sunday.  It should be just take you a few minutes to complete this task, so no excuse for anyone not to complete this step by Sunday.  Anyone who fails to complete this task by Sunday, I will ask one of them to do it at the beginning of the lecture to demonstrate the steps.
